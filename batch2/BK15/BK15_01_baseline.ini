# BICEP2/Keck Array likelihood, including external data from Planck and WMAP.
#
# This file contains input parameters to CosmoMC to reproduce the likelihoods 
# of the baseline analysis from Figure 4 of BICEP2/Keck X. For details of 
# the parameters in the baseline model, see BK15only.ini and BK15.ini, and 
# comments therein.
#
# After generating chains, BK14_01_baseline_dist.ini can be used with 
# getdist to produce plots of marginalized posteriors.
